I enjoy spending my days doing Android Development at General Motors. In my free time I have fun working on neural networks and functional programming (Haskell being my drug of choice). 

Programming is a second career for me. I studied law at the Univerity of Michigan and practiced for 8 years as a judicial law clerk, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, and corporate litigator before discovering my love for programming and switching careers. I joined the great people at [Detroit Labs](www.detroitlabs.com) as a part of their first iOS apprentice class, and I've loved it ever since I made the switch.
